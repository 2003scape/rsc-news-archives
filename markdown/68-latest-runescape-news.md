# Latest RuneScape News
*Published Monday, December 3, 2001*

Due to a huge number of requests we are considering adding level requirements to the armour and weapons in RuneScape. The way this would work is you would need a certain defence level to wear the best armour, and a certain attack level to use the best weapons.

The main reason for this would be to stop the current problem wherby there are low levels players walking around with full-rune which they've been given by a friend (or from one of their own high level character, in direct breach of our rules). Which is considered by many to be something of an unfair advantage.

The levels we are considering are:

Level-5 for Steel

Level-10 for Black

Level-20 for Mithril

Level-30 for Adamantite

Level-45 for Rune

P.S Happy Birthday to me, and to Lightning, and to anyone else who's birthday it is today :-)
