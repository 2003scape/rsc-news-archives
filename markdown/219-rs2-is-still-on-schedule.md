# RS2 is still on schedule
*Published Sunday, November 2, 2003*

I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that we're still on schedule to release the RS-2 beta on the 1st-Dec.
I've been getting into work early, and working a few weekends, and I've managed to make up the time it took to do the Halloween event, so 1st-dec is still on.
