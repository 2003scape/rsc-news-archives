# Compression
*Published Thursday, January 10, 2002*

I've managed to significantly improve the compression used on the RuneScape client. This means the game should now download more quickly. It also reduces the total amount of bandwidth being used by the RuneScape servers, which will hopefully also mean less lag at peak times.

All the maps, graphics and code for the RuneScape client are now compressed into just 687k at a compression ratio of nearly 20:1!
