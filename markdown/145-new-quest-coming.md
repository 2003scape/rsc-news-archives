# New Quest Coming!
*Published Friday, January 24, 2003*

Attention all quest-hungry adventurers!

Some of you may have noticed the lack of updates in the last few weeks... to the untrained eye it could appear that the Jagex team is spending all its time updating the website.

But worry not! We are pleased to announce that there will be a big new update next week, and an exciting new quest from the one they call Tytn. Those of you who enjoyed his Jungle Potion debut should get ready- 'cos this time, things get pretty dark...
