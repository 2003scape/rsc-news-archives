# New server for Australasia
*Published Thursday, May 29, 2003*

Our new Australasian server is now online. This is our first server in the southern-hemisphere!
We've set this server up especially for our Australian and Asian members. Since it's hosted in Singapore it should hopefully provide you with a much less laggy connection than before.

Unfortunately bandwidth in this area of the world is very expensive, (20x more than we pay elsewhere). Therefore this a members only server.
