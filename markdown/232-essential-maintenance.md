# Essential maintenance
*Published Saturday, October 11, 2003*

RuneScape was temporarily offline for about 2 hours this morning for essential maintenance.
We have now passed 5 million user accounts, and therefore I had to make some slight changes to our database to accomodate the vast amount of data this involves.

Due to unexpected complications, I had to reset the master login server. What this means is that anyone who was playing this morning DURING the 2 hour update may find the last few minutes of activity were forgotten. Luckily very few people were affected in this way, and those who were will just find they are standing back where they were when the update started.

I apologise for the inconveniance caused by this maintenance work.
