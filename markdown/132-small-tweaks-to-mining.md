# Small tweaks to mining
*Published Friday, November 15, 2002*

Today we've made the following small changes to mining:

*   You can now mine twice as much silver before getting tired. This is because it was pointed out that it shouldn't really be harder to get silver than gold. This actually now means silver is easier to get than it has ever been in the past

*   We've made it 2-3 times easier to get gems under the new mining system, since that wasn't quite balanced correctly

*   We've added a new mine in the swamp south of Lumbridge with 4 mithril rocks, and 1 adamantite rock, this is to replace the rocks removed from elsewhere. The rocks were moved to make sure everything is the correct distance from a bed for the new system to work properly.

*   We made bread, pies, and pizza restore TWICE as much fatigue as they did before, which should make these foods much more worthwhile. We predict enterprising pizza sellers will turn up at the mining sites shortly :-)

A few confused players seem to think the new fatigue system actually makes mining take longer, but this is not the case. After testing every single mining site at every single level, we can conclusively say that it takes no longer to get ore, or level-up than before. But it's a heck of a lot less tedious and repetitive.

Remember we've added lots of new beds so you might not have to walk as far as you think, we're hoping to add all bed locations to our worldmap soon to help you find them.
