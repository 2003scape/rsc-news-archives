# Quadruple Bank Space!
*Published Wednesday, May 7, 2003*

We are pleased to announce that the Bank of RuneScape has recently finished extending its new secure vaults, deep under each branch.

"We felt," a senior cashier commented, "that many of our customers needed more space for their belongings, and of course, we were only too happy to help!"

This move is the latest in the continuing expansion of the Bank of RuneScape, offering RuneScape members a fourth bank page.

"Its all a big con!" a downtrodden peasant was heard saying in the street, "all they want is to wear your party hats when you're not around!"
