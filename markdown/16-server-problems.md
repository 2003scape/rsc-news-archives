# Server problems
*Published Saturday, April 7, 2001*

We seem to be having a few server problems at the moment. This is due to the large amount of new code we added to the game yesterday. I'm working on fixing it though, so please be patient, and I'll get everything running smoothly as soon as possible.
The good news is that I think I have just resolved the server down-time issues, so hopefully the server won't go offline completely anymore. There is still an issue with certain players having problems when more than 1024 people play at once, this is only a problem at peak times and I expect to fix it on Sunday evening.

Also I expect to get the message boards, current-players, and password-emailing features working again on Monday. These have just been temporarily disabled whilst I get the new server code working properly.
