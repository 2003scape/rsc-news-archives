I've fixed a few minor problems with the new quest. In case you don't already know getting the skin paste now works, and I've just solved the clay shortage problem.

I'd also like to apologise for the slow speed of this site on the 28th-Feb. This problem has now been resolved and we're back to full speed again. I've also ordered a 2nd dedicated server to increase the reliability and speed of RuneScape in the future.
