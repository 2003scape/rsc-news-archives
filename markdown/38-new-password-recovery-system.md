I've changed the system for retrieving a lost password. The new system doesn't use email because not everyone has a secure email account they can use, and people's email address often changes.
Next time you login you will be asked for the answers to 5 security questions. Then if you should lose your password you can use these answers to set a new password on your account. You will only be allowed to set the questions once, after which they are permanently fixed. Therefore you should be careful to choose questions+answers which other people won't be able to guess, but which you will easily remember.
