Well I've just got back from my Christmas break, so now I'm back to updating RuneScape!

Even though I was away visiting my family for 1 week, I managed to get quite a few new things programmed on my laptop, so there should be a nice update to rs2 early next week.

Also I'd just like to wish a happy new year to all our players from the staff here at Jagex.

I hope you had a great Christmas, and wish you all the best for the coming year. It should be an exciting one!

Andrew
