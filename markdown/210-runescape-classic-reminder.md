# RuneScape Classic Reminder
*Published Tuesday, June 8, 2010*

We'd like to remind everyone who's interested in trying out RuneScape Classic, but has not yet logged in since it was re-opened, that the opportunity to do so will only be available for one more week. Only those members that log into Classic (using their normal username and password) before the end of Tuesday 15th June will be able to continue playing it after this date (unless their account is already Classic-enabled).

You can access RuneScape Classic here. New sign-ups should log into Classic worlds 2-6; Classic 1 is only accessible to those veteran Classic players who have stuck with it all the way through.

RuneScape Classic is the predecessor to the current RuneScape game. It was closed to new members over four years ago, but we want for players to be able to try out this important part of our history.

If you have any questions or wish to discuss this, please visit this forum thread.

Note: If you would prefer not to play through the RuneScape Classic tutorial, there is a button to allow you to skip it under the 'Spanner' menu in game.
