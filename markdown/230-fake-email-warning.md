# Fake email warning!
*Published Saturday, October 25, 2003*

There seems to be an increase in fake emails designed to trick you into giving away your password or recovery questions lately.
The latest fake email appears to come from support@jagex.com and has a copy of our secure login appearing actually IN the email. It looks like we have emailed you our login page in an email.

Of course we don't do this! We only ever send plain text emails, without buttons, without pictures, without attachments, and without links to websites (not even our own). And never asking for your password or any other info.

Due to the number of fake emails being sent we are going to stop using email entirely shortly, and give message-centre reminders in game instead.

If you get an email that appears to be from us, then be very suspicious, delete the email immediately, and then go to runescape.com (not via a link in the email) and check your message centre instead.
