Two new severs are now online now. They hosted in a different location to the previous 6 worlds.
This will increase your chances of being able to find a server to which you get a good connection to the game.

One new server is members and the other is free-edition server. This means Runescape now has 8 worlds, a total capacity of 10,000 simultaneous users and a massive 35mbps of dedicated bandwidth!
