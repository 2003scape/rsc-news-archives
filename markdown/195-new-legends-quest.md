Grand Vizier Radimus Erkle wishes it to be known that a new Guild now exists for the truly Legendary Citizens of RuneScape!

Anyone who wishes to access this Guild must accept the challenge of a Quest to map the southern end of Karamja, a dense and forboding area called the Kharazi Jungle.

While there you'll need to make friends with the natives of the Jungle and bring back a fine trophy to display in the Legends Guild Main hall.

This is the 50th Quest we've released, and so to celeberate it's one of the largest yet!

Only serious applicants need apply for the Legends Quest.
