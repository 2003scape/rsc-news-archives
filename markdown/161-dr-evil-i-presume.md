# Dr. Evil I presume...
*Published Monday, February 10, 2003*

Please remember not to give your password out to anyone! The head of Customer Support has informed us about a new breed of super-criminal that is terrorising our super-highways. Although Daniel didn't use those exact words.

We heard from "Dantvman", who was, understandably, still in a state of shock.

"I have just been hacked by a runescape criminal mastermind and I am wondering if I get my stolen items back. The name of the hacker: Rune Banner".

Smelling blood, our support team pounced, eager to finally catch this elusive "criminal mastermind". Here's what they found:

Rune banner: "Do you choose to give me your password and let me log on."

Dantvman: "What is happening?"

Rune banner: "If you give me your password you will not get banned."

That's right folks, he's that good! Blink and you might just miss it. Even the normally hard-as-nails Daniel was said to utter a shrill cry when he read this report. So tie an extra knot in your napsack today, and try and resist the temptation to give away your password to anyone- no matter how ingenious they are...
