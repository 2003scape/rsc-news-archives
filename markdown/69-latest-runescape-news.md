The level requirement poll has finished. Since the majority of the players favoured this change it will be going ahead.

I am fully aware that some smiths and miners feel this will disadvantage them. However remember even if you can't use the items in combat you can still make money from buying and selling them.

I have to consider what is good for the game as a whole, and currently the lack of level requirements is unbalancing the wilderness quite severely and making it largely inaccessible for low to mid level players. I am pleased to see that the most players are in agreement with this decision :-)

The levels requirements will be:

Level-5 for Steel

Level-10 for Black

Level-20 for Mithril

Level-30 for Adamantite

Level-40 for Rune
