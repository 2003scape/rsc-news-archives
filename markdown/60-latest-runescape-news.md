I have decided to remove all the non-essential parts of this website such as the message boards. I have 3 main reasons for doing this:

1.  This saves a lot of server resources and allows me to increase the capacity of the main RuneScape game itself, which is after all the most important part of the website.

2.  Moderating the message boards has become a \* huge\* amount of work lately. I am fed up with all the scamming, swearing, and abuse which goes on here, so they are gone. This will save me a lot of time and stress! I have found that lately I am spending more time managing the website than actually programming new features into the game which isn't much fun and is why I felt things had to change.

3.  Better security - There is now only ONE place where you need to enter your RuneScape Password. You should now only enter your password into the game itself and nowhere else! NOTHING else I have written will ask for your RuneScape password EVER! The game login uses better security than the other web-based features, so this means your password will be even safer than before.

I have also reprogrammed the chat filter in the game itself, to use a more effective system. This is another feature which has been heavily abused, and I'm not willing to put up with it any longer. The new system only allows a limited vocabulary to be used. The new RuneScape chat is only intended for role-playing within the game, not for talking about real life!

I have programmed a new server core, which should in the long run be more reliable and allow more people to play RuneScape at once. You may see a few glitches.
