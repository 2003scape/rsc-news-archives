# New Look Website!
*Published Wednesday, August 20, 2003*

As you will no doubt have noticed, we have given the website a stylish new look - including a new front page which makes our site easier to navigate than ever before. 
This new layout not only looks great, but will give us the flexibility to easily add new features (such as our official forums) in the near future!

We would like to reassure our players that no development time was taken away from RuneScape 2 in the redesign of the website - it was handled exclusively by our web development team.
