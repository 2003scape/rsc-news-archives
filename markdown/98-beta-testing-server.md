# Beta testing server
*Published Friday, June 14, 2002*

I've modified RuneScape to use a database back-end for all the logs, save-games, etc... This is part of the new customer support system we are working on, and makes it a lot easier for us to sort out problems.
Obviously to make this change I've had to alter a LOT of code. So I'm running a test server based on the new core before switching the live-version of RuneScape across.

If you want to us test this new beta version of RuneScape please visit:

http://www.runescape.com/betaclient.html

Please note that the main RuneScape saves games are NOT available on this server, so you will need to create a new account to play on it. Also this server will be taken offline after a few days and everything done on it will be permenantly lost. Using this test server does not affect your real character in any way. It's purely for testing, and also a rare chance to play in a brand new world where everyone is equal.
