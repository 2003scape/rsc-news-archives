New **members only** weapons are AVAILABLE NOW!

Members will now be able to smith Throwing knives for themselves, or find Spears dropped by various enemies.
Both weapons are used to attack enemies at range, and are more powerful than arrows, but cannot be stacked in the inventory like arrows can be.

Also if you are attacked while a throwing weapon is equipped you will automatically defend yourself with it.

To use these new weapons, simply equip them in your inventory, and click on an enemy. Throwing weapons utilise and increase your Ranged skill.
