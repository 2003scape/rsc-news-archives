# Singapore server relocated
*Published Monday, August 25, 2003*

Following a lot of negative feedback regarding the Singapore server we've decided to relocate it. It seems that it just doesn't provide a better connection to most people in that part of the world, despite being physically nearer.
Our poll showed that even amongst people living in Australia and Singapore, a mammoth 63% found it WORSE than our other servers, and only 16% found it significantly better. This is very disappointing and clearly doesn't justify keeping the server there. Especially given how much hosting costs are in that part of the world (10 times the price, of what we pay in san-franciso!)

Therefore our Singapore server is being taken offline today, and we are shipping it to Toronto - Canada, to see if it can be of more value to our users there.
