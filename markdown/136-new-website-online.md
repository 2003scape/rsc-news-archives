*Published Wednesday, December 11, 2002*

**New website online!**
After many weeks of hard work our new website is finally online - think of it as an early Christmas Present! We hope that you will find the site easier to use and to find your way around.

Although we have tested the site as best we can, if you do find any problems, please let us know through the 'Feedback' section in our 'Customer Support' area accessible via the main page.

Cheers,

\*\*The Jagex Team \*\*
