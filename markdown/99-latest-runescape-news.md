We've updated RuneScape and added another two members quests.
In the first quest a mysterious stranger called Lucien asks you to retrieve an artifact known as the Staff of Armadyl. Speak to him in the 'flying horse' in Ardougne.

In the second quest you must restore the clock tower south of Ardougne to working order by finding and assembling the missing parts. Talk to Brother Kojo in the clock tower.

We've also added a fishing guild west of Hemenster which requires fishing level 68 or higher to enter.

World map updated - The map has been extended to the left to show the city of Ardougne and other new members areas we have added recently.
