I have fixed a recent error in the friends list where it would sometimes incorrectly show people as 'offline' when they weren't. I have also increased the maximum capacity of this list from 50 friends to 100 friends. Finally the friends list is now automatically sorted so your friends who are online appear at the top of the list.

I have made a few more improvements to the chat filter. I am still working on this however.

Also I know a few people were upset to see the removal of the 'server status' page, I forgot to mention that this was removed because in a few days time I will be adding an automated hiscore table to this website which will show the top 1000 players in each skill.
