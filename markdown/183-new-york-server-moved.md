We have moved our New York server (hosting worlds 13 and 14) to San Francisco because a very large number of players told us the New York connection was very poor. The fact that very few players actually used these worlds in their old location backed this up.

Hopefully worlds 13 and 14 will now run much faster, on their new connection in San Francisco.
