# New Payment Options
*Published Tuesday, March 18, 2003*

Jagex is very pleased to announce two fantastic new subscription options, **Pay By Phone** and **Pay By SMS/Text Message!**

Pay by Phone is currently only available to residents of the United States and the United Kingdom, and Pay By SMS/Text Message is only available to residents of the United Kindgom.

You can check out these new payment options by navigating through 'Members Info' and 'Click here to Subscribe' from the main page.

We hope that these quick and easy payment options will allow even more of our free players to enjoy the benefits of a RuneScape Members' account! However please be sure to get permission from whoever pays the phone-bill before using this.
