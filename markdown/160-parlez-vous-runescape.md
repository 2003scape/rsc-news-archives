To all those who were surprised with yesterday's news about the educational benefits of Runescape- you weren't alone! Everyone at Jagex was also intrigued by this great new justification for playing computer games...

So I am pleased to announce that yesterday was no fluke. It appears that Runescape also operates as a teacher of foreign languages- especially if you're not actually English in the first place.

"I just wanted to say thanks to all runescapes team. Last winter, I didnt know a word in english. I started to play runescape and I learned to talk the language very fast."

OK, so there's a bit of punctuation missing, but it's no worse than most of the stuff that everyone else seems to manage! "Im a girl from quebec and I talk french" continues our linguistic friend.

"Its an easy way to learn languages.Now im in high english class at school :) thx a lot. It would be very cool if there was a german,spanish,etc.. version of runescape."

Indeed it would- just watch this space...
