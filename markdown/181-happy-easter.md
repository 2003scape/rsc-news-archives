# Happy Easter
*Published Sunday, April 20, 2003*

Happy Easter to all our players!

For a bit of fun, we will be dropping 'Bunny Ears' at random locations at random times throughout the day.

Please remember - these are supposed to be just a bit of fun for Easter. We've noticed on previous occasions players hoarding huge numbers of the gifts we drop, and then reselling them for massively unfair prices. This really isn't in the spirit of the occasion. :-)

We don't want this to just become an event whereby a few lucky players suddenly become ludicrously unfairly rich. Therefore new holiday drops are non-tradeable and limited to one per player. But hopefully still a lot of fun.
