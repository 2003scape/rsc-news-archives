# Runescape updated
*Published Tuesday, May 8, 2001*

I've just updated runescape to add the following features:

*   Better smithing tables, with more even spacing of items
*   New goblin quest - help the goblins find a new look for their armour!
*   New crafting skills - make jewellery and pottery

I have also just received the 3rd server I promised, I am now configuring it, and hope to have it online shortly.
