# Multi-part quest
*Published Tuesday, August 27, 2002*

Epsiode<sup>sic</sup> 1 of our new multipart quest is now online.

Edmond's daugher<sup>sic</sup> Elena has gone missing in West Ardougne whilst trying to help the plague victims there. See if you can find out what's going on. The story started in this quest will be continued in future updates.

We have also added a new Ardougne teleport spell for high level magicians, and a new bank in East Ardougne.
