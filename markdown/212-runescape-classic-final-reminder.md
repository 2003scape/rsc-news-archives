# RuneScape Classic: Final Reminder
*Published Thursday, September 29, 2011*

Now is your final chance to gain access to RuneScape Classic for your account as, after the 29th of September 2011, new sign-ups will no longer be available and will not be re-opened.

RuneScape Classic is the original version of the game, which ran prior to the release of the RuneScape that we know and love today. It contains 50 iconic quests, has bags of retro charm, and is a great insight into the history of the world's most popular free to play MMORPG.

Accounts which are able to log into Classic are also eligible to purchase the classic cape and matching hood in the current version of RuneScape. As well as looking very cool, the cape also comes with an appropriately old-school emote.

To secure access to Classic for your account, log in via this link now. Please note that you'll need to be a member to do so. Once you have logged in, you will be able to do so indefinitely. Remember that it is a separate game, though, so if you're logging in for the first time you'll enter Classic as a daisy-fresh beginner.

Don't delay! Log in now to secure yourself a slice of RuneScape nostalgia.
