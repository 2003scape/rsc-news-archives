Firstly I have fixed the error which enabled you to make double doors vanish by lighting a fire next to them. So hopefully no more trapped people.

I've also modified the trading window, so that you can point at an object someone is offering you to find out the objects name and description. This will help make trading fairer and safer.

Some new locations have been added to the map, there is a new shop in Al-kharid where you can buy plate-mail skirts.

The 'champions guild' has been added south-west of Varrock. Only Adventurers who have proven themselves worthy by gaining influence from quests are allowed in.
