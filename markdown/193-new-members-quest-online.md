# New Members Quest Online
*Published Monday, July 28, 2003*

Our new members quest Gertrude's Cat is now online.
Gertrude's cat has been missing for some time now - for her piece of mind her prized pet must be rescued.

Handling cats isn't an easy business. They get hungry and need plenty of attention but if you're the pet type, then this is the quest for you!

The cat is also a mini virtual-pet! If you look after it properly, it will grow up and get bigger. However if you neglect it then it will run away.
