We (correctly) anticipated that nearly everyone would want to try the new flethcing<sup>sic</sup> skill at once and that this would cause a rare-tree shortage! Therefore for just one day we decided to make these trees not turn into stumps like normal.

Now everyone has had a chance to try the new skill this has been put back to normal. To compensate the amount of xp you get from woodcutting has been increased.

We've also changed fletching slightly because we saw a lot of people weren't bothering to put the string on their bows. This obviously wasn't intended! Therefore the proportion of xp you get from stringing the bow has been increased. In actually fact you now get more xp from making a completed bow, but you have to finish it off to get the full amount.
