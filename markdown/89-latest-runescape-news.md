We've made a few fixes to RuneScape today. The demon in the family crest quest was too deep into the wilderness, which was causing a major pking problem and wasn't too popular, so we've now moved it the wilderness dungeon at a much lower wilderness.

We've fixed a bug with magic spells which people were abusing to rapidly fire multiple bolts and kill other players unfairly.

Now you can drink a potion even if your stats are already boosted. Your stats will still not go higher than the maxmium the potion allows, but this means emptying vials you don't want is easier, and you don't have to wait for the potions effects to fully wear off before boosting your stats to max again.
