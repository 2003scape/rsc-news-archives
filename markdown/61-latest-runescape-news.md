The new chat filter isn't working quite as well as hoped. Therefore I have decided to REMOVE it! I have worked out a different way of filtering the chat which will be far more effective than using a limited dictionary, which I will be adding shortly. This means you will be able to talk 'normally' again soon.

Update: If you notice any words that the chat filter is blocking, and you feel it shouldn't be then send an email containing those words to words@jagex.com. Please DONT include a message in the email, send the words you want adding only! If you cannot say your characters name please do NOT tell me, I am fixing this issue separately.

Also I know a few people were upset to see the removal of the 'server status' page, I forgot to mention that this was removed because in a few days time I will be adding an automated top 1000 players list to this website. :-)
