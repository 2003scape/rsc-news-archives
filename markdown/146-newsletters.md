# Newsletters
*Published Friday, January 24, 2003*

To make use of our exciting new website, we will be posting the Runescape Newsletter online from now on, and it will NOT be emailed out to players any more.

This will also get round the problem of fake newsletters sent out by those nasty scamming types, as well as making Saradomin's words of wisdom available to a much wider audience.

Speaking of his holiness, the big man has been rather quiet in the last few weeks- I hope he's OK...
