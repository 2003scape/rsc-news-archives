We've increased our bandwidth even further to a total of 40mbps to further improve the quality of our service.

I'd like to welcome another new employee Kyla who is now working in our London office and will be handling billing queries and problems.

Work on the new fletching skill is progressing very well. We're now in the final stages of testing and hopefully the skill will be online early next week. Plus we've nearly finished a new members quest which should go online at the same time.

We are going to order yet another server to run another two worlds. This time based in New-york. This will give users a choice of three different hosting companies to connect to. Once this goes online there will be a total 7 free worlds, and 3 members worlds.
