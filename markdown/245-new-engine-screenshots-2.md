# New Engine Screenshots #2
*Published Tuesday, July 22, 2003*

Progress on our big RuneScape update is still going very well, so I've put together another screenshots page showing the latest features added.
Finally, I'd just like to remind you that you should NEVER enter your password ANYWHERE but RuneScape.com. When the update is ready for testing we will put it here on RuneScape.com for everyone to see, and will post about it in our 'news'. Beware scam sites or emails that offer to let you try it out early, they are merely trying to steal your password.

Enjoy! - Andrew
