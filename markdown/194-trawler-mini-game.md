Murphy the trawler fisherman has recently docked in at Port Khazard. He's happy to take any keen fishermen on a fishing trip with him.

Be warned though, his boat is not in the best of shapes for the high seas, and you'll be spending a lot of time running around fixing leaks.

This far out at sea you never know what new and exciting things you might catch, especially if you are an experienced fisherman. That is, if you can stop the trawler from sinking and get back to port safe and dry with your catch!
