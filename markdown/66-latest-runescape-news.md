# Latest RuneScape News
*Published Monday, November 26, 2001*

I've made a few tweaks to RuneScape over the weekend to fix a few minor problems: The 65535 objects in a stack limitation has been removed, so you can now carry and trade as much gold as you like. Some people were experiencing lag in crowded areas when a lot of people were talking. To fix this the chat is now compressed, and the chat filter has been optimised. A few other bug fixes, for instance the game now correctly displays your privacy settings in the options menu.
