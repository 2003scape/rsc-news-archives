# RS2 beta - date decided!
*Published Wednesday, October 1, 2003*

Work on our massive 'RuneScape-2' update has gone very well in the last few weeks, and we feel sufficiently confident in our progress to finally commit to an exact date for the public beta test.
The beta test will begin here on www.runescape.com on the 1st-December-2003. For more info on how the beta will work please refer to our RS2 FAQ.

We would like to thank all our current members. Without your support this massive update wouldn't have been possible. In recognition of this members will get first try of the beta on 1st-Dec, with a free-players launch following a few weeks later.

We are now going to focus all our resources on this update to make sure it's ready on time.
