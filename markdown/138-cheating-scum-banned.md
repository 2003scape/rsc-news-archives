If you cheat at RuneScape you will be banned. We have very advanced detection routines, and we can tell if you use programs to control your character for you. We've just banned over 400 players for cheating in this way. Many of whom were high level members.

We'd like to remind our players that using macros to play for you is NOT allowed and we WILL permanantly<sup>sic</sup> ban you for it, no exceptions!
