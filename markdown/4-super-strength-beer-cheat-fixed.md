Today it came to my attention that by drinking huges amount of beer players were able to make themselves super strong, and then go killing everyone! This has now been fixed so Beer can only increase your strength slightly. Many thanks to the person who told me about this one. If you know of any more cheats/tricks let me know so I can fix them and make RuneScape a fair place for everyone.
