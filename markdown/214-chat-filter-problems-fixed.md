# Chat filter problems fixed
*Published Monday, July 28, 2003*

A problem which was causing the chat-filter to incorrectly filter things it shouldn't has now been fixed.
We are now using a more advanced system which shouldn't cause so many false positives and so should hopefully be much less intrusive.
