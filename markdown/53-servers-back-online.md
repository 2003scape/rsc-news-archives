Runescape is now back online! The reason is was unavailable last night is because my hosting company 'skynetweb' had a power failure which reset one of my main servers. (so much for their backup power-supplies, and supposed reliability!) Skynetweb have had repeated problems since I joined them, so I guess it's time to find a new hosting company.
