# RuneScape Classic Temporarily Re-opened
*Published Tuesday, June 1, 2010*

As we did just over six months ago, we are delighted to offer everyone another opportunity to try RuneScape Classic for themselves! For two weeks starting from today, Classic will be open for new sign-ups from RuneScape members only.

If you log into Classic during this two-week period (using your normal username and password), you will continue to be able to do so after the two weeks are over. If, however, you do not, you will miss out on the chance to do so, so give it a try.

If your RuneScape account is already ‘Classic-enabled’ (either from the last time we did this or from before that), then you do not have to log into Classic during these two weeks to keep it as such, but you are more than welcome to log in to say hello to those players new to Classic.

You can access RuneScape Classic here. New sign-ups should log into Classic worlds 2-6; Classic 1 is only accessible to those veteran Classic players who have stuck with it all the way through.

RuneScape Classic is the predecessor to the current RuneScape game. It was closed to new members over four years ago, but we want for players to be able to try out this important part of our history.

If you have any questions or wish to discuss this, please visit the Recent Updates thread in your forum community.

Note: If you would prefer not to play through the RuneScape Classic tutorial, there is a button to allow you to skip it under the 'Spanner' menu in game.
