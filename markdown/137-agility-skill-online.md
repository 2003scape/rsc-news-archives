We've just added another massive members update. The long awaited \[http://runescape.com/lang/en/aff/runescape/viewcategory.ws?cat_id=788 agility skill] is finally available. You can practice on two different training courses, or try the agility dungeon.

We've also added a new quest which uses the agility skill - called the "Grand tree quest". This is set in an enormous new area called the Gnome stronghold which also includes loads more besides the quest. Even more agility quests will of course be added in future updates.
