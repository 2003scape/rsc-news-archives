# RuneScape Classic mass ban
*Published Wednesday, October 27, 2004*

3000 RuneScape Classic players were banned today for using macro software to cheat. This type of software is against the rules (see rule 7).

The number of people cheating in this way on RuneScape Classic was getting out of hand and most users will agree it was really starting to ruin the game so we felt it was time to take action. Therefore the 3000 most severe offenders have been permanently banned.

Whilst we are no longer actively developing RuneScape Classic, and whilst it has far less macro detection mechanisms than our main game RuneScape, it does still have some significant protection, so don't think you can get away with cheating at EITHER of our games. Breaking the rules in either of our games will not be tolerated.
