# Library of Varrock expands
*Published Thursday, October 16, 2003*

Our favorite librarian Reldo sent a messenger to let us know that the Library of Varrock has expanded its public viewing area.
Reldo had the following to say:

*King Roald of Varrock has gratefully agreed to be Patron to my efforts to create a full, true, and accurate history of this world in which we live. I have made a start by opening two new sections available to the public; [the official histories page](http://www.runescape.com/kbase/view.ws?guid=lore), and the tales [from the tavern](http://www.runescape.com/kbase/view.ws?guid=lore).*

*Please be advised if checking out any manuscripts or documents that they are to be returned on time, and late fees will be deducted at a rate of 2 gold per day.*
*I also ask visitors to keep the noise down in the research areas, or their library card may be revoked.*

You can see for yourself the newly expanded Library of Varrock [here](http://www.runescape.com/kbase/view.ws?guid=player_submissions).
