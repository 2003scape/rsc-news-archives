As part of our commitment to stop scamming of all forms, today sees the launch of the new RuneScape secure Message Centre.

The Message Centre allows us to communicate with you about your account in a much more secure way than email does. As long as you are sure that you only log-in at the official RuneScape website, you can be sure that any messages in your Message Centre are from Jagex.

For now, only Jagex Staff can send messages to your Message Centre - but we hope to be introducing player-to-player messaging in the future.
