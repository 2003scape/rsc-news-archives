# Varrock Library updated
*Published Monday, November 24, 2003*

Reldo, our accident prone librarian, writes to inform us that he has once again expanded the [Library of Varrock](http://www.runescape.com/kbase/view.ws?guid=lore) with both some more Tales and some more Histories.
Those fans of Reldo's literary collections should make their way there immediately, as the library will adhere to its usual opening hours.
