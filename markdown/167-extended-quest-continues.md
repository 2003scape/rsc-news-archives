# Extended Quest continues!
*Published Monday, February 24, 2003*

Anyone who has completed the Biohazard quest will know that King Lathas sent a team of scouts to find a way through The Underground Pass. This will allow a band of adventurers to go in search of the evil King Tyras, Lathas' brother, who has forged an alliance with the Dark Lord.

You might also like to know that we've just heard back from an advanced party of scouts, who keep the King informed of their progress.

The scouts have dug a tunnel into the huge mountain range that separates the mapped world of Runescape from the unchartered territories to the West. They have not yet managed to dig all the way through, but the King is anxious to send in his warriors asap- next week in fact.

So wrap up warm and pack plenty of food for the long journey ahead. Reaching the frontierlands<sup>sic</sup> should then be a mere formality. We couldn't find out anymore than this, because at this point the scouts were rambling quite a bit. But that was probably just the drink talking.

You, however, must keep your mind on the job in hand. If Tyras is not stopped, the whole of Runescape will surely be doomed!
