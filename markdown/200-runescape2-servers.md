We have added another three worlds to the RuneScape 2 beta to add more capacity for downloading and playing RS2.

We were also experiencing some bandwidth problems with our servers located at San Jose, but these have now been resolved.

Thanks to all of our members who have been very patient in waiting to download the RuneScape2 client - our servers were always going to be very busy with so many of you wanting to download the game right from the start!
