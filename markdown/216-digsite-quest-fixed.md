# Digsite quest fixed
*Published Thursday, July 10, 2003*

 Unfortunately the digsite quest released yesterday had a number of problems, and was not possible to complete as a result.
 These problems have now been fixed, so it is now possible to complete the quest. You can get the specimen-brush you need to finish the quest by pickpocketing one of the workmen.

 I sincerely apologise for the botched release of this quest. The members of staff responsible will be fed to the king-black-dragon shortly.
