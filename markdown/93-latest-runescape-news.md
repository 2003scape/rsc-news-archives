# Latest RuneScape News
*Published Friday, May 10, 2002*

Both members and free-edition runescape have been updated with new content.

First up the members wilderness has been expanded to include: a new level-56 wilderness area, scorpion ravine, pirate hall, rogues to pickpocket, doors to lockpick, high level wilderness dungeon, shadow-spider monster, fire-giant monster.

Members also can now trade wood certificates for those valuable logs, and purchase/steal spice from the spice stall which when added to stew before cooking can be used to make curry (heals 19hp)

With all these new wilderness areas for members we've decided to make some of the older wilderness areas available to free-edition users. Explore the bandit camp, dark warrior castle, and overgrown village. Free users also now have access to the crafting guild

Both members and free versions have been updated with a new 'make-over mage' character, who can change your character appearance... for a price!
