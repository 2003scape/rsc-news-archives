Hi there,

So by now I imagine you're all enjoying the new website. Less clutter, more space and generally a more Runescapey feel. I'm sure there will be some who don't approve, but Runescape will always have its diehards, ready with an anecdote about the days when you could pk everywhere, and the economy held its value. Just remember that they will have fought in more wars than you, so they're entitled to be a bit upset that inflation has wiped out their pension.

But with Tom's Grand Tree Quest last week, and Tytn's Zombie Queen Quest coming soon, I'm sure that even the most po-faced players will be smiling right now. So this might be a good time to point out that the newsletter is now every two weeks, as the more observant amongst you will have already noticed.
