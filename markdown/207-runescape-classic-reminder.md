# RuneScape Classic Reminder
*Published Wednesday, November 18, 2009*

We'd like remind everyone who's interested in trying out RuneScape Classic, but has not yet logged in since it was re-opened, that the opportunity to do so will only be available for one more week. Only those members that log into Classic (using their normal username and password) before the end of Tuesday 24th November will be able to continue playing it after this date.

You can access RuneScape Classic here.

RuneScape Classic is the predecessor to the current RuneScape game. It was closed to new members over four years ago, but we want for players to be able to try out this important part of our history. We also have potential further plans for Classic (as discussed in this blog), so another reason for this re-opening is to see how many people are interested.

If you have any questions or wish to discuss this, please visit this forum thread.

Note: If you would prefer not to play through the RuneScape Classic tutorial, there is a button to allow you to skip it under the 'Spanner' menu in game.
