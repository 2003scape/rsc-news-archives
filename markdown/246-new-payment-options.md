# New Payment Options
*Published Monday, July 21, 2003*

 Jagex is very pleased to announce a fantastic new 'Pay By Phone' subscription option for players in Australia and New Zealand.
All you need to do is dial a special number from your home phone and the cost of the subscription will be charged to your phone bill! (Just remember you must get permission from the person who pays the phone bill before using this service.)

You can check out this new payment option by navigating through 'Members Info' from the main page and 'Click here to Subscribe', and then clicking 'Pay By Phone'.

We hope that this quick and easy payment option will allow even more of our free players in Australia and New Zealand to enjoy the benefits of a RuneScape Members' account!
