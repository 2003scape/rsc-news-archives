# Real World Trading Rule Added
*Published Tuesday, September 9, 2003*

We would like to make everyone aware that we have added Rule 12 to our rules.
This rule says that: 

*'RuneScape items must only be exchanged for other items/services within the game. Exchanging RuneScape items for real-life money or other real-life benefits is not allowed.'*

This is not a new rule - it has always been part of the terms and conditions that every player agrees to when creating their account. However, we felt that this needed to be made absolutely clear, so it is now also part of our rules.

The reason for this is simple - We want RuneScape to be a game where everyone has the same chance regardless of their wealth in real-life.

This is also the reason we don't sell RuneScape items for cash on our own website. Even though we could make extra money in this way. We don't think it's fair or even fun if players can just buy their way to the top!
