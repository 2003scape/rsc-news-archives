I went away for a short holiday on saturday, and it seems RuneScape promptly broke in my absence. It seems I can't even take 1 week a year away from running this game! I'd like to apologise for the people who have experienced connections problems over the last few days.

I've decided to abort the remainder of my holiday and have come back to the office to fix RuneScape instead. I'm currently transfering the database to a new server which is 6 times faster than the old one which should hopefully get things running smoothly again. Once again sorry things weren't working 100%.

Now I'm back at work I should be able to get it working smoothly fairly quickly.
