# 5th RuneScape server online
*Published Tuesday, July 17, 2001*

I just finished setting up another server help run RuneScape. The new server isn't being used to run another parallel world, but is instead working behind the scenes to help manage the save-games.
This gives a total of 3 world servers, and 2 support servers. This should hopefully increase the total system capacity to 4000 players at once.
