It seems to me that the current player combat system isn't ideal. The fact that the vast majority of players have opted to be 'non-playerkiller' seems to confirm this. Therefore I'm considering changing to a new system which more people should enjoy.
With the new system different areas of the map would be allocated as combat or non-combat zones. In the current map area (including all the major cities and mining sites) no fighting would be allowed. To cater for players who want to fight each other I would instead add a huge new area around the edge of the map called 'The Wilderness', where player combat is always allowed.

The further out into the wilderness you go the more dangerous the game becomes, and the less restrictive the combat rules become, (so right at the very edge anyone can fight anyone!). But there will also be more treasure available to tempt people into venturing out despite the danger. If you don't want to fight you don't have to enter the wilderness area at all.

As well as the change above, I would also a new "duel" option to allow players to fight each other in the main non-combat zone. Duels would work a bit like trading, in that both players would have to agree before a duel could commence. Before the duel starts the players get to agree on the stakes (what the winner gets), and if things like magic and food can be used during the battle, and if retreating is allowed or not. This would allow you to try fighting other players in a much more controlled way, and should hopefully be a lot of fun for people who don't want to get involved in just randomly killing other players.

This would be a major change to the game. I know the newbie killers won't like it all, but I am trying to cater for the majority, not a few individuals. So please use the form below to let me know your opinion.

What do you think of the proposed new combat system?
