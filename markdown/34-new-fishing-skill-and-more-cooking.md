# New fishing skill and more cooking
*Published Monday, June 11, 2001*

I've added a whole new skill for you to try in RuneScape! There are various fishing points scattered around the rivers and ocean. Go to the fishing-shop in Port Sarim to get the equipment you need and then try your hand at fishing. There are 10 different fish to catch, and 5 different fishing techniques to try!
As well as the fish, there are now even more things to cook and eat in RuneScape.
