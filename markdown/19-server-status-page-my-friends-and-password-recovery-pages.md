The 'current players' page was getting too long so it's been replaced with a new 'server status' page which tells you the number of people currently playing, and lists the top players who are logged in. So you can still tell which of your friends are playing I've also added a new 'my-friends' page which tells you if the people on your friends list are online or not.
I've also got the lost password recovery feature working again. It's now available by clicking 'lost password' on the menu to the left and entering your account details.
