# Library Updates
*Published Wednesday, October 29, 2003*

Our esteemed librarian Reldo has contacted us with the following announcement:
*"Due to a recent donation from an anonymous benefactor, I am glad to announce that the Royal Library of Varrock has expanded its browsing library slightly, and to accomodate this new space we have moved some more manuscripts from the old archives to the reading rooms.*

*You will find that we have some new Tales and Histories available for public viewing."*

In other news, the benevolent deity Saradomin, who never likes to be outdone, has just sent us the latest installment of the ever popular responses to players' questions in [Letters 17](http://www.runescape.com/kbase/view.ws?guid=letters17) which as usual has been archived for future posterity in the Library of Varrock.
