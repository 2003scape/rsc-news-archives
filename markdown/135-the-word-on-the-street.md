# The Word On The Street

Hi there,

Here at Jagex we've received a lot of feedback about the new mining system. The general consensus is that it's now less tedious, and more strategic. And everyone is pleased that you can finally use beds.

As for the Jagex team, we've been busy preparing for the launch of a new look website. Tony, our resident graphics man has been beavering away with his virtual pencils, to come up with a design that knocks the socks off the current set-up (not so hard, some might say...) The new website is far more user-friendly and easy to navigate. Runescape.com will be a separate site from the Jagex page, so you'll be able to get straight to the action. And the whole thing looks pretty tasty to boot.
