# Halloween Drop
*Published Friday, October 31, 2003*

Hi everyone

I hope you're all enjoying Halloween. For a bit of fun we are dropping 'Scythes' at random locations at random times through the day.

As is normal for holiday drops now, the scythes are untradeable and limited to one per player. The only way to ever get one is to find one today!

If after finding a scythe you lose it, you can get a replacement from the clothes shop. However the shop will only give you a replacement if you manage to find one on the ground today.

Our previous drop has also been changed to work the same way, with the clothes shop offering replacements (rather than it auto appearing in your inventory after you die) .
