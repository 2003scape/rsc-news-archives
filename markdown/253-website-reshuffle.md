# Website Reshuffle
*Published Thursday, May 22, 2003*

You may have noticed that the RuneScape website looks a little different, and that's because we decided that the previous layout didn't allow us to deliver all the content that we want to.
The new layout opens the way to help us to introduce some exciting new features in the near future, and we hope that you will find it easier than ever to navigate our site.
