# Screenshots of the new engine!
*Published Monday, May 26, 2003*

Progress on our big RuneScape update is going very well, so I've put together a page with some screenshots of the new graphics, and other information about the update.
[Click here for screenshots](http://www.runescape.com/screenshots/screenshots.ws)

However please remember to NEVER enter your password ANYWHERE but runescape.com. When the update is ready for testing we will put in on runescape.com. Beware scam sites that offer to let you try it out early, they are merely trying to steal your password 

Enjoy! - Andrew
