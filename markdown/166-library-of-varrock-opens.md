# Library of Varrock Opens
*Published Friday, February 21, 2003*

Reldo the Librarian has finally opened the doors of the long awaited Library of Varrock!

Reldo has been busy of late, archiving all the letters of Saradomin and Zamorak. Today however, he found a set of dusty magical scrolls in a locked cupboard. These 'bestiary' scrolls, scribed<sup>sic</sup> by noneother<sup>sic</sup> than the RuneScape Gods themselves, are the forthcoming creature blueprints for the new 3D RuneScape world!

Despite his fear of Divine intervention, Reldo has released some of these scrolls through the Library. If he survives for the next few weeks, he may well pick up the courage to release more...
