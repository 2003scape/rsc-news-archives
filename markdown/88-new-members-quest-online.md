The Fitzharmon family crest has gone missing, and the family honour has been lost. Can you find the crest and return it to Dimintheis in Varrock? There are 3 different rewards available, but you can only choose one, so choose carefully!

This is another difficult quest to complete. Next we will be working on some low level quests, to ensure there is a good balance of quests for all levels of player.
