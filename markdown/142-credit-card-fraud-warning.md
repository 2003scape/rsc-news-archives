Don't accept membership from other players - doing so is dangerous!

We would like to remind everyone that you must NOT allow another player to pay for your runescape account membership.

If someone offers you either a low level members account or offers to upgrade your own account to a members account (usually in return for runescape items), the chances are that the way they are paying will be fraudulent. When we discover this, we will cancel the payment, and then ban your account permanently. So please do not fall for this trick.

The general rule is, if its too good to be true, it normally is!

Fraudulent payments will be unearthed and result in automatic and permanent bans for all concerned. All transactions are logged. We can track and prosecute anybody attempting to make fraudulent payments. It is not allowed to pay for the membership of someone outside your family.
