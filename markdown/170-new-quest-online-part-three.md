# New Quest Online - Part Three
*Published Monday, March 3, 2003*

Today sees the release of the third part of our ongoing Members' Quest.

The War against the Dark Lord continues. In order to track down the evil King Tyras, you must first make your way through
We now know from our team of scouts that the pass is in fact a deep and complex labyrinth, which is all but empty of human kind.

Your job is to find a way through the pass, so that King Lathas can send his troops through to the frontierlands of West Runescape.

We had hoped to get this information from our scouts, but for some reason we had trouble getting much sense out of them. One of them spoke of a man named Iban, but this was clearly lunacy, as Iban was of course the great Dark Knight who died many years ago.

The Underground Pass follows on from the Plague City and Biohazard Quests.
