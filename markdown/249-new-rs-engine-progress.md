# New RS Engine Progress
*Published Monday, June 16, 2003*

I know lots of you are wondering how the RuneScape engine update is progressing so I've taken a few minutes to update my progress chart with the latest figures.
This is my personal progress chart, and so only show aspects of the update that I am working on. We'll probably get some of the other staff who are converting the maps and quests, to post their own progress reports too.

**Andrew's progress chart for RuneScape-Engine-Update**

[Numbers in square brackets indicate updated progress as of 16th Jun]

Please note you can't easily work out a release date from these numbers since the tasks are not all the same size or difficulty. For example the script interpreter is probably as complex as all the secondary tasks put together since it controls every single aspect of the game.

Not only are the tasks different sizes, but also as more tasks are completed it is possible to reuse earlier code more. For example the close-range combat took a long time to do, but the other combat types will be able to reuse much of the same code so should be far faster to complete. This is why it is difficult for us to give an exact release date
