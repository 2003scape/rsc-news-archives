We have finally found the time to update the RuneScape online manual. The manual now contains instructions for all the main aspects of the game, as well as guides for individual skills such as smithing and crafting. I have also updated the world map to show the most recent additions to the world. The map is now in a separate section to the rest of the manual, just use the link above to view it
