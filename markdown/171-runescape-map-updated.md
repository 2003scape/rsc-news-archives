After many days of surveying, pacing and measuring, the Runescape cartographers have finally returned to the Library of Varrock.

Reldo the Librarian is pleased to announce the release of a new map of the known Runescape World, available through the manual section. This new map is now fully up to date, to give adventurers the drop on Yanille, The Tree Gnome Village and even Tutorial Island.
