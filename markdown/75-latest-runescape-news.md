We are planning on a launching a new optional service called 'RuneScape members' fairly soon. This is in ADDITION to the existing 'RuneScape freeplay' service which we intend to keep running.

Being a member gives lots of great new features and skills. We currently plan to make it $5/month or $45/year, and to accept both credit-cards and money-orders. The prices are in us-dollars, but we will also accept other currencies. The idea is that the revenue from 'RuneScape members' will enable us to add even more improvements to the game and allow us to keep it going for many more years.

We're now in the final stages of preparing our members service, so over the next few days you might start seeing new areas and quests in the game which you can't reach. These will then be opened up for members when we are ready.

The members service is NOT yet available, so there is no need to e-mail asking how you can get it. As soon as it's done you'll be able to subscribe from this website. We don't have an exact launch date, but obviously it will be as soon as possible.
