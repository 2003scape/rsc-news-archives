# New abuse reporting system!
*Published Wednesday, September 11, 2002*

We've added a new 'abuse report' button to the RuneScape game which sends an untamperable snapshot of recent chat/trade events directly to customer support.

This means there is now a VERY easy way for us to catch all the people misusing our game and ban them once and for all! If you continue to be abusive or break the rules now the new 'report abuse' system is online then you WILL be caught almost immediately!

Please do NOT misuse the 'report abuse' feature. This is feature will allow us to catch and remove the trouble makers from our game. Help us clean up RuneScape by only using this report for serious cases.
