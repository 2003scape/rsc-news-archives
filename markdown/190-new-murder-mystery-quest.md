''"Sarge, come quick!"

''"What is it lad?"

*"We've had a messenger from the Sinclair Mansion; seems like someones done in old Lord Sinclair"*

A murder? Here? On his watch? This wasn't good news.

The fact that the old Lord was a close personal friend of the King didn't make it any better. Someone was going to pay for the crime, and he had a horrible feeling if it wasn't the murderer it was going to be him.
He called all guards not on active duty to the barracks.

*"Right lads, all leave is suspended as of now. We want every spare man at the mansion going over it with a fine tooth comb. Anyone have any complaints about it?"*

The junior guards could see the expression on his face and decided not to raise any objections.

*"Excellent. See you all at the Sinclair Mansion in 10 minutes. And we're not leaving until we've caught the villain."*

As the guards left in single file he hoped they found the culprit quickly; murders didn't happen very often and failing to solve the killing of a friend of the King wouldn't help his career prospects much.

As the last guard left he muttered under his breath

\*"Yes, this is a real murder mystery alright..." \*
