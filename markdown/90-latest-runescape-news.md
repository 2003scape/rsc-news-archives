Jagex customer support is back online. Sorry for the recent downtime. Membership signups are also now functioning again

I am also pleased to announce that we now have 3 full time members of staff to answer your questions, and a 4th person is joining us on Tuesday! This increased number of staff will enable us to give you more rapid support, and will also mean we are better able to find and punish the players who are breaking our rules.
