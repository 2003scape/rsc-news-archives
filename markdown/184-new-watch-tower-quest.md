# New - Watch Tower Quest!
*Published Wednesday, May 7, 2003*

The young wizard on duty in the Yanille Watch Tower scribbled another tally onto the newly created 'ogre activity report'. It had been a long shift, and the ogre sightings were getting more and more frequent. For a second, the wizard allowed his eyelids to drop...

"They're gone! Who's on watch?!"

The young wizard awoke with a start, "What's going on?" he enquired, sensing the panic around him.

"I could well ask you that!" the senior wizard retorted, standing over the bewildered youth. "Locks smashed, doors wide open and the power crystals - gone!"

"Gone?! But, without the crystals..." the reality of the situation was hitting him like a Wind Strike in the chest.

"Exactly." the senior wizard replied, placing a firm hand on the young wizard's shoulder, "Without the crystals, Yanille is doomed."

"Our only hope," a voice from the doorway said "is that some brave adventurer is willing to take on this Watch Tower Quest"
