# Yet another new quest, and new options menu
*Published Wednesday, February 28, 2001*

Prince Ali of Al Kharid is being held captive by the Lady Keli. If you think you're up to a daring rescue mission then go to Al Kharid and talk to Chancellor Hassan. This is a long quest with many parts! Many thanks to Rab for the many hours he spent creating it, and to Paul for configuring it for use in the game.

I've been working on a new options menu, to allow you to configure the game to your liking. So far there are only 2 options. The 1st option allows you to choose the behaviour of the camera, the new camera mode is the first step in a new system I am developing, which will ultimately make RuneScape run MUCH faster for people with slow computers. The 2nd option is to switch your character between PK and non-PK. (you can only switch twice, so choose carefully). I will be adding more options to the menu as required.

I've also been working on a system to support clans/friend-lists. This isn't ready yet, but work is progressing well and I expect it to be available soon.
