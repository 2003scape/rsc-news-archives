I've been busy making lots of minor alterations and bugfixes to the game. The main changes are:

*   My-friends webpage now works properly, and also shows which server they are on

*   You can now private message friends even if they are playing on the other server

*   Windows client now lets you select which server to use

*   Reorganised the stats list to prepare for coming updates

*   Improved speed and reliability of the servers

*   Introduced new quest-point system to replace the old 'influence' system

*   Fixed 'using ranged combat advances other skills too' bug

*   Fixed 'impossible to mine gems' bug

*   Fixed 'pottery menu wrong way around' bug

*   Fixed 'server sometimes sends wrong error message on login' bug

*   Fixed 'friends list gets blanked on lost connection' bug
