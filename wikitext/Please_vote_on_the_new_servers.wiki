{{Update|date = 10 September 2001}}

As you probably know yesterday Runescape moved to a new ISP. Please help me access the quality of my new servers by voting with the form below. I know some people are finding them better, and others are finding them worse. I'd like to know percentages so please could everyone vote below to let me know.

Moving the servers was very expensive so I hope lots of people are finding an improvement. Also note that I am unlikely to move the servers back to their old ISP regardless of the result of this survey, since I just can't afford to do so. I just don't have enough money for another move due to not enough banner clicks.
