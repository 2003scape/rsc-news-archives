New members quest online - The sea slug quest

Something mysterious is happening on the new offshore fishing platform. People who've gone on their regular fishing trip just haven't returned! Can you rescue the missing father and son from the unknown horrors out at sea?

We've also added the ablitity to catch oysters whilst fishing with a bignet. The pearls from these can be used to make powerful crossbow bolt tips. Plus we've added two new certificate traders in Zanaris.
