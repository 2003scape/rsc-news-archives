{{Update|date = 19 March 2002}}

Two new runescape worlds are now online! These new worlds are hosted in a different location to our previous 6 worlds to increase your chances of being able to find a server to which you get a good connection to the game. 

I've made one of the new worlds a members server, and one of them a free-edition server. This means RuneScape now has 8 worlds, a total capacity of 10,000 simultaneous users and a massive 35mbps of dedicated bandwidth! Once I'm happy the new hosting company is ok I will buy another 2 uk worlds to increase our capacity even further.
