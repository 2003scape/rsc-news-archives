{{Update|date = 28 January 2003}}

All budding athletes and gymnasts out there will be pleased to know that there is now an even better way of improving your agility. Just head down to your nearest deep wilderness...

We've put in a high level assault course for anyone who is hell-bent about building their agility XP. So pack yourself a napsack and get ready for some serious lava-dodging action.

Of course you do run the risk of dying painfully in a hail storm of arrows, but nobody said that getting perfect abs would be easy. As our head of Customer Support would say: no pain, no gain.
