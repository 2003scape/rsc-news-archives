{{Update|date = 9 October 2002}}

Just wanted to let you know some exclusive behind-the-scenes news from Jagex!

The Runescape team is still busy working on the 3D update - a fairly massive undertaking as you might imagine! The 3D characters are now pretty much complete, with Andrew now turning his attention to the landscape design. The use of polygons allows for far more attention to detail, as well as giving a more enhanced sense of proportion.

As for buildings, the paper thin walls of old will be making way for structures that are satisfyingly chunky, and the windows are now extruded from the walls, rather than being flat texture maps.

Perhaps best of all will be the use of a moving vertical camera. Take an aerial view and get the drop on your enemies, before swooping in to see them face to face.

We don't yet have a final release date for all this, but at this stage you could say that things are looking pretty tasty. As usual please remember any previews of the our work will ONLY be on runescape.com NEVER enter your password anywhere except runescape.com. We will of course keep you posted on all this.
