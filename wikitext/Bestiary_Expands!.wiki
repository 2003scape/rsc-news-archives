'''Bestiary Expands!'''<br>
Reldo the Librarian has recently been swamped by his work - quite literally, as a tall and badly balanced pile of books he was cataloguing fell to the powers of gravity and trapped him under a pile of assorted Varrockian literature.

Some might say that this was no accident after his previous defiance of the gods in releasing the bestiary scrolls, but Reldo is nothing if not dedicated to the life of the Librarian, and simply cannot rest until every single article in the library is catalogued and sorted.

Luckily for RuneScape players, as he struggled to free himself from the large pile of heavy books he found some more '''previously hidden scrolls expanding the bestiary in the Library of Varrock to almost double what it was!''' And luckily for Reldo his injuries should heal fairly quickly.
