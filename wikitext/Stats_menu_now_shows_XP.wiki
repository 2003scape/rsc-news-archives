{{Update|date = 13 August 2001}}

Due to a huge number of requests, the stats menu now shows you the exact number of experience points you have in each skill, and the number you need to reach to advance a level. For the more detailed information about a particular stat just point your mouse over it, and the numbers will be shown at the bottom of the menu.
