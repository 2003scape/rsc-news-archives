{{Update|date = 8 May 2001}}

I've just updated runescape to add the following features: 

*Better smithing tables, with more even spacing of items 
*New goblin quest - help the goblins find a new look for their armour! 
*New crafting skills - make jewellery and pottery 

I have also just received the 3rd server I promised, I am now configuring it, and hope to have it online shortly.
