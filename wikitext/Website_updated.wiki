{{Update|date = 15 August 2001}}

I have just updated the worldmap. It now shows the mining guild and the very south edge of the wilderness. The whole wilderness isn't shown however, so you'll have to explore it for yourselves! I've also added 4 new message boards, to give a total of 8, because the old boards were getting extremely crowded. Enjoy!
