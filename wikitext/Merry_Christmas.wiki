Merry christmas from the Jagex team. We're dropping some santa hats today at random intervals in random places. They're just a bit of fun though, so please don't be too upset if you can't find one. If you manage to get more than one then please consider giving them to your friends as christmas presents. Of course you can sell them but that's not really the spirit of christmas :-)
