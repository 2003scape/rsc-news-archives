'''New News Section '''<br>As you will no doubt have noticed, the Runescape news section has had a makeover. This is part of our effort to communicate to you more often, and we will be regularly posting news in the appropriate sections that you can see above.

Clicking any of the category names will show only news of that type, most recent first. Clicking 'All Categories' will show you all news items.

We hope that you will find the new news section easy to use, and more importantly, up to date with current Runescape affairs.
