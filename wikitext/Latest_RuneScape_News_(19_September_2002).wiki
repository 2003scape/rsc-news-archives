{{Update|date = 19 September 2002}}

We're still working on the big graphical update. It sure is a lot of work! It's still a way off, so meanwhile we're going to show occasional previews of how things are progressing.

As well as improving all the graphics, we're also reworking all the animation to use a lot more frames so everything moves more smoothly. Here is a preview of how some of the monsters/people look using our new animation system.
Remember: Don't be fooled by fake websites, offering to let you test the new version. It's not ready yet, and we are not running any tests of this sort. NEVER enter your password ANYWHERE except runescape.com, or you will lose your account!
