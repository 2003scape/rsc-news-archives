{{update|date=15 August 2002}}

We've just got another 2 members' quests online.

The 1st quest is the Hazeel Cult quest. Thieves have stolen the Carnillean family armour, and you are asked to recover it. This quest is a bit different because there are two very different ways of completing it! Will you side with the Hazeel Cult or with Ceril Carnillean?

The 2nd quest is the sheep herder quest in which you must safely herd four plagued sheep away from the city of Ardougne before the citizens become infected! Speak to Councillor Halgrive to start this quest.
