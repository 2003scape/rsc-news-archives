'''Very Important'''<br>
With all the talk of romance in Runescape recently, we'd like to remind players about the importance of playing the game safely.You should NOT give out your personal details to other players online- even if they claim to be Jagex staff! This includes your name, address, phone number and email address.

Unfortunately we have to be aware that internet games are played by certain dangerous individuals, who may lie about their age, gender, occupation etc.

For this reason you should stick to using your friends list as a safe way of communicating with other players online. You can block messages if you feel uncomfortable with someone, and you should contact customer support if you have any concerns about another player's behaviour.

If you do decide to ignore our advice and meet up with someone in person, please make sure that it is in a public place, and that a parent or guardian comes with you. You should also let your friends know where you will be. For more information, please see our online [[Manual:Account Security|manual]]. To read more about chatting safely online, please visit www.chatdanger.com

Finally, please remember that even though you may get on well with someone online, you can never be absolutely certain that they are for real. Please bear this in mind at all times.
