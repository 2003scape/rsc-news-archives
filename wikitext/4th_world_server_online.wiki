{{Update|date = 9 September 2001}}

After many days of work I've finally managed to get my brand new servers working! I've setup a much needed 4th world server, and I expect to transfer the rest of the runescape worlds and website to the new servers shortly.

'''Update:'''Everything except the webserver is now running from my new servers. Hope everything is working well, many users have reported lower lag, but a few have reported increased problems so I guess it depends where you are. Also people have been mentioning they can't get the new windows client to work. Remember you CANNOT run 2 copies of the windows client at once, this means after downloading the new version you must close the old copy before starting the new one, or it won't work!
