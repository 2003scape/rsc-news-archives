Think you've got what it takes to slay a dragon? If so try our new quest! This quest has been designed with the more experienced runescape players in mind so it's fairly tricky.

To start the quest go and talk to the guildmaster in the champions guild. From there you will have to solve a series of puzzles before travelling to slay the dragon itself. Only heroes who have proven themselves worthy by completing this quest can purchase and wear the best armour in the game. The new rune platemail body!
