{{Update|date = 4 February 2003}}

To all those who have been waiting patiently for the Library of Varrock, it will be opening soon! Regulars to Misthalin's fair city will have been marvelling at the slow but steady construction of this great new building. And for those who haven't found it yet, it's right behind that tree, next to the man who stands there sometimes.

And just as the building is close to completion, we find out- and you're never going to believe this- that's right, we've still got loads of empty shelf space.

Perhaps you might know of some stories for the library. These could be great tales of myths and monsters; epic fantasies of courage and honour, of 250-400 words in length, and which don't include the names of actual Runescape players. OK, you can include YOUR name- I know some people like to work on their ego XP stat.

Just send any finds to our good friend Saradomin. Having been Zamoraked off the letters page, he needs something to pick up his spirits. Just don't try to rewrite too much of Runescape's complex history (stick to the story itself). Old Sara's a stickler for accuracy- but then if you created a whole universe, you would be too.

So this should be a day to rejoice for all you bibliophiles. And anyone who just likes books.

Write your letters to Saradomin@jagex.com
