{{Update|date = 17 March 2001}}

I've just uploaded this weeks update. I was really hoping to get a lot of interesting new features added this week, but due to a worrying amount of attempted cheating and password stealing I've had to spent most my time programming the system to detect and stop that instead.The players who continually try to break the rules are merely depriving themselves and everyone else of more interesting improvements. This week's updates are:

*Added a button to email forgotten/stolen passwords back to their owner 
*Made changing your password easier (there is a new option in the config menu) 
*Added timeout to conversations - to prevent people blocking shops
*Added code to detect which players are attempting to break the rules

Luckily whilst I was busy doing this Paul had time to add a cook's guild which you can only enter if your cooking skill is 32 or better. Cooking has also been improved with a wider choice of things to make. (You can now make a variety of different pies.)
