Rumours of a distant village in the southern part of Karamja Island have been filtering through. It appears that the mysterious Jungle island still holds a lot of potential adventure. It is said that strange items are to be found, unique to this part of the world, ready and waiting for adventurers brave enough to search for them. Of course, there is hearsay that these treasures are protected by supernatural guardians, but it's highly unlikely, surely? Also the jungle has it's own dangers, what with well camouflaged spiders and the deadly Jungle Ogre. Who knows what terror lies further south?

When considering all this, it might be best to just stay at home? Perhaps the danger is too much and the rewards not enough? Yes, brave adventurer, stay another night in the warm inn, feed your face with another warm meal and worry not about the untold riches south of Karamja - or the terrors that guard them.
