{{Update|date = 10 April 2001}}

I have now fixed the majority of the problems with the new server. All the major problems are now sorted, and I'm now working on a few less critical issues. I'm also going to update the world-map as soon as possible so you can find your way around Asgarnia.
More good news is that I have just put the message boards back-online. I have taken the chance to redesign and improve them, so I hope you like the new design!
