Tutorial Island

First-time players will now start their adventures on tutorial island, where the good people of RuneScape are busy preparing people for the challenges that await them.

Waterfall Quest (Members' quest)

Walk along the river that flows through Kandarin, where the locals speak of hidden treasure, and the legend of the Elven King.

King Black Dragon (Members' monster)

The most fearsome monster ever to venture into RuneScape has now... err... ventured into RuneScape.

So for all you plucky young upstarts, take a break from emailing customer support and pit your wits against the deadliest beast to date! More prudent types might just want to gaze at him from afar. Of course you'll have to find him first.
