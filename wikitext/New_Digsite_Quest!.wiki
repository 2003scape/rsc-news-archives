Some say there are only two religions in the land of Runescape; Saradominist, or 'the good', and Zamorakian ('the bad').
But there have been many other gods at work on the land...

For many ages religious wars wracked the lands, and the victors decided to write history as they saw fit, denying the existence of other deities. The zealousness of Saradominists and Zamorakians almost wiped all trace of other deities from the land... until now.

Now, a more enlightened and modern time, people thirst for knowledge and power, giving rise to those who follow no deity - for no deity meets their beliefs. Turning their back on their family religions older gods were rediscovered, altars, temples and holy places long forgotten are found once more.

Most recently a previously hidden altar has been discovered, buried deliberately under tonnes of rock and earth by a saradominist settlement that once existed nearby in their efforts to suppress its' existence...

What wonders might exist there? What unknown treasures, or terrible secrets can be found in the digsite quest?
