{{update|date=3 July 2002}}
We upgraded the runescape system to use a new database backend today, this will enable us to offer a much improved customer support service, and to continue making further runescape improvements in the future.

The game is now back online, our billing and customer support servers are still offline, but should be available again tommorow{{sic}} if all goes well. Thank-you for your patience whilst we perform this essential upgrade.
