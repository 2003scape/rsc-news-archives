{{Update|date = 9 May 2001}}

The new runescape server is online! I was planning on testing it a bit more and launching it tommorow, but so many people are trying to play tonight that the system couldn't cope so I've been forced to launch it early. Hopefully everyone who wants to play will be able to now.

Important: You can only play on one server at a time. If you try to log onto both servers simultaneously with the same account you will be told "Invalid username/password". This message should read "Username already in use", but currently does not. I will fix this tommorow, and I will also improve the page which lets you select the server so that it displays the number of players in each.
