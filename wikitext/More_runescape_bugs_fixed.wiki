{{Update|date = 23 June 2001}}

I have now fixed the following bugs with runescape:

*improved password box to allow up to 20 characters
*fixed it so you can still stack extra runes/arrows even when your inventory is full.
*fixed a bug which could cause stack of 0 coins to be created
*fixed a bug with arrows of different types not stacking on the ground properly
*fixed it so that leaving the bank displays your balance properly
*improved runescape auto-update code
*logging out now works properly when you log out at the exact moment of attack
*fixed it so people no longer randomly get added to your friends list
*fixed it so lumbridge and karamja shops don't share the same stock!
