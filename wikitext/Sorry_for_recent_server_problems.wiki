{{Update|date = 27 May 2001}}

Any regular runescape players will have noticed that the servers have been experiencing problems over the weekend. I have been working extremely hard to try and resolve this problem, and hopefully everything will be back to normal now. I believe it was caused by a memory leak in the new magic system which I added on Friday. I have now fixed the memory leak so hopefully the server will now be stable. I apologise for any inconvenience caused. - Andrew
