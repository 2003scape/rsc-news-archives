{{Update|date = 24 June 2003}}

WARNING: Beware of anybody claiming the RuneScape 3d beta is available. It is NOT yet available.

We are aware of a fake program, which pretends to be our 3d update, but actually steals your password.

Do NOT download or run any programs claiming to be RuneScape from ANYWHERE except runescape.com ever!

When the real version of the 3d update is ready it will be announced here on "runescape.com"
