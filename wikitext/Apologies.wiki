'''Apologies'''<br>
We would like to apologise to anyone whose game time was interrupted last night. Our UK service went down, due to a powercut at Telehouse.

This was, unfortunately, out of our control, but Andrew is now looking into the matter. We hope it did not cause too much inconvenience to our UK players.
