{{Update|date=17 March 2003}}

A new quest is now online!

Professor Gronigen has had trouble with some neighbouring goblins, who have managed to break his telescope. Idiots.

Help the Professor to repair the telescope, and he will show you the secrets of the stars, and the cosmos as we know it. Broaden your horizons in The Observatory Quest.

Finally you can take a break from killing each other and ponder on your role in the Universe.

And those of you that communicate with Saradomin and Zamorak may be interested to learn that there's a little something extra for those that manage to complete this particular adventure...
