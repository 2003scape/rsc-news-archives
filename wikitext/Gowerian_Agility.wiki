'''Gowerian Agility'''

Hi there,

So what a week it has been. Two new quests, dragon bones, improved monster AI and a magic guild to boot! By now I am sure many of you will be busy trying to find a cure for the plague, or mixing potions with special properties. Just make sure you save some time for Runescape.

I know that many of you in the forums will be pleased about the new monster update. Those "players" who rely on macros and other such cheats might not be so chuffed.

So what's been happening in the Jagex offices? Well, Paul has been working on his skills, and particularly agility. He's up to about a 200 sit-ups a day, and he's talking about throwing in some squat thrusts too. He isn't what you'd call match fit yet, but with Tom, Tytn and myself taking care of the quest side of things, you can be sure that such things are not being neglected...
