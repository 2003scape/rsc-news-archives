{{Update|date = 13 August 2001}}

I just fixed a couple of bugs with the new systems. I've fixed a problem with the wilderness, whereby low level archers were able to attack high level players in the wilderness without being attackable back! And I've fixed a problem with the new stats menu where the XP indicator didn't update properly. 
Also bear in mind that we might tweak the wilderness a bit over the next few days if it proves to be unbalanced, although everything seem ok so far. We are also planning on adding a dualing system which will allow combat outside the wilderness if both players agree to it.
